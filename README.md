# TEXT CLUSTERING USING BISECTING K-MEANS ALGORITHM

* Implement the Bisecting K-Means algorithm.
* Deal with text data (news records) in document-term sparse matrix format.
* Design a proximity function for text data.
* Think about the Curse of Dimensionality.
* Think about best metrics for evaluating clustering solutions.

### Conclusion:

Text clustering was performed successfully implementing K-Means and Bisecting K-Means algorithm. Same was evaluated using Silhouette Metric. The data was dealt using document-term sparse matrix and curse of dimensionality was cured using singular value decomposition.
